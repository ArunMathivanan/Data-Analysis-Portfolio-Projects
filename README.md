# **Apple AppStore Data Analysis Project - SQL and PowerBI**

As a part of my Data Analysis Portfolio projects, I have worked on this project which give Data-Driven Insights for Aspiring App Developers.

## **Problem Statement** 

In the fiercely competitive landscape of the Apple App Store, aspiring app developers face the challenge of navigating through myriad genres and language options to achieve success. This project addresses the critical need for data-driven insights to empower developers in making informed decisions. By leveraging historical data and conducting insightful analyses, the goal is to identify the optimal app genres and language support strategies that will maximize the potential for success in the dynamic and crowded App Store environment

## **Task List**

-  Import the Applestore & appleStore_description CSV files into SQL server
-  Check for missing or blank values and do the necessary data cleaning steps and make the data ready for analysis.
-  Do the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and analysis the key results.
-  Import the data files into PowerBI 
-  Create necessary calculate columns and measures needed for Visualization to present the insights
-  Make the visualization and create an interactive dashboard in PowerBI


## **Skills Learned**

- Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Sub Querying, Window functions, CTEs in Microsoft SQL
- Create Calculated columns, Write complex measures using DAX formula in PowerBI
- Create different types visualizations and interactive dashboard in PowerBI 
- Format the interactive dashboard using color schemes and background templates.

## **Tools Used** 

_Microsoft SQL Server, PowerBI_

## **Key insights from the Data Analysis**

**1. Monetization Model:**

**Finding:** Paid apps tend to have higher ratings than free apps.

**Explanation:** User investment in a paid app may lead to increased confidence and commitment.

**Actionable Insight:** Adopt a freemium model, offering high-quality features in the premium tier to attract user investment and potentially boost ratings.

**2. Language Support:**

**Finding:**  Apps supporting 10-30 languages have better ratings.

**Explanation:** Balancing language reach with user satisfaction is crucial for app success.

**Actionable Insight:** Prioritize languages within the 10-30 range based on the target audience to maximize accessibility without overextending resources.

**3. Genre Performance and Counterintuitive Ratings:**

**Finding:** Finance and Book apps have lower ratings despite high performance.

**Explanation:** Specialized genres may attract specific users with high expectations.

**Actionable Insight:** Enhance user experience, address common pain points, and manage expectations to improve ratings in these genres.

**4. App Description Length and Effectiveness:**

**Finding:** Apps with longer descriptions have better ratings.

**Explanation:** Detailed descriptions can build trust, showcase features, and manage user expectations.

**Actionable Insight:** Craft informative descriptions that highlight key features and address concerns for an optimal length rather than sheer volume.

**5. Target Rating and Setting Realistic Goals:**

**Recommendation:** Aim for an average rating above 3.5.

**Consideration:** Consider setting gradual benchmarks based on industry averages and competitor analysis to build towards the long-term goal of 3.5.

**6. Competition in Games and Entertainment:**

**Finding:** Games and Entertainment genres have high competition.

**Actionable Insight:** Identify niche subgenres with lower competition, develop a unique app concept, and consider targeting specific user demographics or addressing underserved needs within the chosen subgenre.

These refined insights provide a clear and actionable roadmap for app developers to enhance their strategies and improve the overall performance and satisfaction of their apps in the market.
