### All in on digital transformation: Creating a stronger, nimbler, more resilient future!

The digital revolution and our fast-changing world requires a skills revolution. And it’s not just about the digital skills. The skills revolution is about helping people build their digital awareness, emotional intelligence and creativity to fully participate in the digital future workplace — and it needs to start now.

At PwC, we are working with other organisations across the world, building on our work with clients and on upskilling our 276,000 people. Still, more must be done if we are to ensure everyone has the opportunity to learn, work and participate in the digital world. This is at the heart of our purpose.

We are enabling employees who are motivated to further accelerate their skills to do so by offering them a “career pivot” to become what we call “Digital Accelerators”. Accelerators rapidly deepen their skills in digital specialties, such as data, automation, AI, and digital storytelling by learning a variety of self-service tools and coding languages and applying these skills across our business.

## Task 2: Customer Retention

A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

* Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
* The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
* Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
* We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
* We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

The engagement partner provide the following tasks :

1. Define proper KPIs
2. Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
3. Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

* Boost sales of 1 and 2-year contracts by 5%.
* Implement a yearly increase of 5% in automatic payments.

## Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion

Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

* number of men
* number of women
* number of leavers
* % employees promoted (FY21)
* % of women promoted
* % of hires men
* % of hires women
* % turnover
* Average performance rating: men
* Average Performance rating: women

### Key Insights :

#### Hiring :

**Gender Disparity:** There is a significant imbalance in the hiring proportion, with only 41% of hires being female and 59% male. While the HR department shows a positive exception, it suggests potential bias in other departments.


**Targeted Departments:** Focusing on increasing female hires in Sales & Marketing, Internal Sales, and Finance could be beneficial, considering the current imbalance.


**Age Distribution:** The majority of hires are in the 20-29 age group. Consider broadening the age range to capture diverse experiences and perspectives.

#### Prmotion :

**Positive Trend:** While still not equal, the number of female promotions increased from 2020 to 2021. This is encouraging, but further progress is needed.


**Senior Positions:** Less than 4% of women were promoted to senior positions. Analyze promotion criteria and address any potential bias that hinders women's advancement.


**Performance Gap:** The average performance rating is almost identical for both genders. This suggests focusing on objective criteria for promotions rather than relying solely on performance ratings.

#### Employee Turnover :

**Part-Time vs Full-Time:** Higher turnover in part-time roles is likely due to various factors like lower job security, benefits, and career progression opportunities.


**Departmental Differences:** Operations and Sales & Marketing have high turnover rates for both genders. Analyze specific factors contributing to this and implement retention strategies.


**Strategic Department:** While lower female turnover in the Strategic department is positive, consider actively encouraging and promoting talented women within this department to leadership roles.
