I was born into this world at a random time/place.) Therefore, given the fact that I exist here and now, it is much more likely that the human species will either die off soon or at least not blowup into trillions and trillions of people over the next hundreds of millions of years. The probability is simply proportional to the number of humans living now over the total number of humans ever to have lived or ever will live. For instance if there are 7 billion people living now, plus another 2 billion total that have lived throughout history. Then if only another 1 billion are to be born in the future, then the odds of me living now (and thus the relative odds of this scenario) is 7/(7+2+1) or 7/10 (or .7 or 70%.)\n\n (Since these are ""Fermi Number"" approximations, the exact numbers don\'t really matter, just the order of magnitude.) \n\nAnyway, if, like in the late example in the video, we are on the verge of a huge population explosion, then the odds go down proportionally. Let\'s take the lower end and assume another 1 trillion people will be born in the future. Then the odds of my existence (and thus this scenario) go down to 7/(7+2+1000) or 7/1009 or about .00693 or 0.69%.)\n\n\nI understand the dangers of anthropic arguments like this, especially with an example set of 1.

This high level of emissions is largely attributed to the export of consumer goods and a heavy reliance on coal\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\r\n\r\nUnited States: Following China, the United States had CO2 emissions of 4.535 gigatons.

Despite having a high total emission, it's important to note that India's per capita emissions are lower compared to other major emitters due to its large population. India's emissions are primarily from its expanding industrial sector and increasing energy demands\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\r\n\r\nTogether, these top three emitters contribute a substantial portion of global greenhouse gas emissions.

uzkD5SeuwzM,"['Hey Everybody! So this video is a remake and remaster of an older video that has a mistake in it. You can watch the original here: https://youtu.be/ZL4yYHdDSWs\nWhat is the mistake? In a nutshell: In the original video we said that it was PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the local group and reach other galaxy groups. That the rest of the universe is moving away from us too fast to catch up. But that‚Äôs wrong. It is not PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the Local Group, just extremely unlikely that we‚Äôll ever do it. \nBUT: If you have a lot of time and a fast spaceship you can still get to a limited amount of galaxies ‚Äì these galaxies will eventually get out of reach forever but until then, they are technically within reach. So why did we keep the video up and didn‚Äôt purge it when we deleted our addiction and refugee crisis videos?\nWell, it has to do with the nature and severity of the mistake: We did talk to a few astrophysicists to ask them what they thought and if we should take down the video. Their feedback was pretty clear, they thought it was still fine as the universe expansion things explained in the video are correct and they didn‚Äôt consider the local group thing as too major. This was actually a case of ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. \nAlso, back when this original upload happened, Kurzgesagt was operating at pretty tight margins and just redoing a video was not easy for us. Back then the team was small and we were fighting to put new videos out. So we just swallowed the bitter pill and kept the video around.\nBut the video still bothered us, as far as we know this was the biggest unfixed mistake on the channel. Super frustrating, especially because the core idea of the video is so fascinating. The limit of our species. The actual limit. So yeah, we finally remade the video, sorry for taking this long, life got in the way.\nThe original video will stay up, you can compare the two if you want to see how far we have come in a few years in terms of production quality. All in all, we could only grow the channel and work on getting better because of direct support from you guys.

The other atrocity is - Decarbonise = Depopulate. The Cult demands decarbonisation.\nThere is only one question to ask yourself. Is CO2 good or bad?\nHere is a fact the climate cult will never tell you - CO2 (PLANT FOOD) is the trace gas of life that barely exists in our atmosphere (0.042%), without which we and every other carbon based life form does not exist. Without CO2 (plant food) this is a dead planet. Plants die below 150ppmv. At 200ppmv plants are barely surviving. At 300ppmv plants are surviving but far from happy. Today we are at 425ppmv or 0.0425% and we have a greening planet that is creating enough biomass to feed 10 billion people and every other animal. At 1000ppmv the planet becomes so abundant it would be a garden of Eden. \nAs the planet has warmed very gently from the Little Ice Age starting around 330 ya, CO2 also started to rise some time after as the oceans slowly warmed and commenced out gassing CO2 naturally. We and every other carbon based life form has benefitted from the warmth and extra plant food (CO2). How do we know this. It‚Äôs called history. Humans have always thrived during warm periods such as the Minoan, Roman and Medieval warm periods. All life starts to die off rapidly during cold periods such as the Little Ice Age where hundreds of millions of people died before their time from hypothermia, crop failure, starvation, diseases and other cold related medical conditions between 1350 and 1850. 500 years of death and devastation where only the strong and the lucky survived.\nFear the cold, worship the warmth. Just ask a greenhouse farmer why they pump CO2 into their warm greenhouses. Plants love it and they thrive in CO2 levels of 1500ppmv and much more if farmers could afford it.\nThere is no scenario where CO2 increases cause trouble as natural warming caused by the sun and several other natural cycles controls CO2 levels. CO2 has never controlled the temperature as it is a minor Green House Gas (GHG). Water is the major GHG by far. The only reason the climate cult has demonised CO2 is because we would laugh at them if they demonised H2O. The only scenario where we are in trouble is when C02 decreases through the stupidity of man made carbon capture which requires huge amounts of energy. This is also an absurdity like no other. CO2 is the gas of life and it can only be good and not bad as the climate activists suggest. \nWe are at historically low levels of CO2 which has steadily decreased from 7000ppmv some 540 million years ago when complex life burst into existence during the Cambrian Explosion. The reason complex life appeared was because there was an abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere and the planet did not catch fire as the doomsday cult would have you believe. CO2 is a minor GHG that will slowly increase as the climate warms through natural processes as it always has millions of times before now. Our CO2 contribution is minor and overall a net benefit to the planet as we are seeing from satellite images that clearly show a greening planet. There is no climate crisis, just a science crisis where fake climate scientists pander to their incompetent government/UN/WEF paymasters who reward their fake data and misinformation that CO2 and climate change is bad.\nHow do you know a scam from the truth.

You can get it here:\nAppstore: http://kgs.link/universe-app-ios\nGoogle Playstore: http://kgs.link/universe-app-android\nOh boy. Making an app is hard. It seemed so easy when we started. We underestimated the necessary work load and all the potential problems tenfold ‚Äì this is not a figure of speech, this took ten times longer than we thought it would. And we are sort of used to working on big projects. So the first update to the app should hopefully be here in the next 24 hours (we are waiting for approval of the update in the app stores) ‚Äì it will fix a bunch of small things that slipped through. We‚Äôll constantly improve this thing because while it was honestly a horrible nightmare to make, it also was fun and we want to get better at it and make more things in the future. In case you don‚Äôt know Wait but Why btw, it is the best and most fun blog on the internet (https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html) and if you don‚Äôt know it you should change that like right now. Tim and I collaborated for the first time in 2013 and we have been good friends ever since. And this thing was something we started talking about years ago.\nSo what is this thing we made and why? You can seamlessly travel from the smallest things in existence, past the coronavirus, human cells and dinosaurs all the way to the largest stars and galaxies and marvel at the whole observable universe. You can learn more about each object or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all. It‚Äôs a fun plaything. The app is inspired by the ‚Äúscale of the universe‚Äù website by the Huang Twins that Tim and I spent a lot of time with when it came out years ago ‚Äì and felt that it was finally time to create a Wait but Why and Kurzgesagt version.\nThere are no in-app purchases and no ads. All future updates are included! Since this is our first app we would love to hear your feedback so we can improve it over time. Leave us a five star review if you want to support it.

The intense heat and blast wave caused by the explosion would result in the destruction of buildings, infrastructure, and densely populated areas within a significant radius. The number of casualties would be enormous, with immediate deaths occurring due to the blast, heat, and radiation exposure.\r\n\r\nThe survivors would face numerous challenges, including severe injuries, radiation sickness, and long-term health effects. The infrastructure necessary for essential services such as healthcare, transportation, and communication would be severely compromised, making rescue and recovery efforts extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nThe long-term consequences of a nuclear attack are equally devastating. The release of radioactive fallout would contaminate the surrounding area, making it uninhabitable for an extended period. The environmental damage, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of water sources would have severe implications for the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the psychological and societal impact cannot be overstated. Survivors would face trauma, grief, and the challenge of rebuilding their lives in the aftermath of such a horrific event. The international community would be deeply affected, leading to political instability, increased tensions, and potential retaliatory actions.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the use of nuclear weapons is internationally condemned by the majority of nations. Various treaties and agreements, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), aim to prevent the use and spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament.\r\n\r\nOverall, the use of nuclear weapons is a grave and destructive act that should be avoided at all costs. The focus should be on promoting peace, diplomacy, and finding nonviolent solutions to conflicts.', 'Question: how do they make those nukes?', 'The problem is without nukes countries will invade eachother causing much more death and suffering then a bomb ever could', 'damn i would just choose to evaporate by the blast than suffering from the radiation', 'You got me at nuke-', 'it is terrifying what humans are capable of', ""I want to see a town or a whole state that faced a nuke, i'd like to explore it, it'd be like fallout"", '?']"

What if their hair and skin can become young again if they slept as much as they could- 14-15 hours a day, like babies do?

They just chill ALL the time. Lying on a rock or going with the waves in the ocean. Maybe we humans and animals age and die because we‚Äôre always busy with things, and we don‚Äôt sleep as much as we can. Maybe that ability to sleep is there so that we could live to be thousands of years old or even forever.

It‚Äôs stated everywhere that 7-8 hours is enough, but we can sleep twice as much as that. I hope that you or someone can research this, and maybe you can do that fastest with mice. I feel their heart beats so fast because they get cold faster, even in a house. Their body can‚Äôt retain much heat because of their size. They might be able to live for double their average lifespan of 4 years. Rats live longer in hotter areas of the world, I‚Äôve noticed that while looking into it. \nMy biggest hope is that someone can go to a nursing home and pump the temperature up to 87 and give them all they can eat and all the marijuana they want to smoke( it helps them sleep better) and see what happens in 15-20 years of sleeping 15 hours a day. If their hair comes back and their skin dewrinkles then that‚Äôs the natural cure for death and aging right there. \n\nPlease share and like so that there may be attention to this.

However, among the leaders of Thalath, an ambitious ruler named Xarion felt an imagined threat as he observed the development of life on Arkan. His fears, born of unfounded paranoia, led him to make a devastating decision.\r\n\r\nIn an unprecedented act of hostility, Xarion ordered a powerful gamma-ray burst (GRB) to be unleashed, aiming to extinguish life on Arkan.

While life on Arkan flourished, the shadow of the GRB loomed on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThroughout the millennia, the Thalathians wrestled with the responsibility of their own dark past. Society was divided between those seeking redemption for Xarion's mistakes and those preferring to ignore the grim legacy.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the GRB reached Arkan, the Thalathians witnessed the collapse of a civilization that could have continued to prosper if not for the impulsive decisions of its own leader.\r\n\r\nThe legacy of Arkan became a constant reminder of the dangers of unfounded paranoia and hostility.

In a nutshell: It is not PHYSICALLY impossible to leave the Local Group as we said in this version. It is just extremely unlikely that we‚Äôll ever do it, even for the standards of our videos.\nBUT: If you have a lot of time and a fast spaceship you can still fly to a limited amount of galaxies ‚Äì these galaxies will eventually get out of reach forever but until then, they are within reach. Although every second some of them escape us forever.\n\nOk, if this is so why did we keep the video up and not purge it when we deleted our addiction and refugee crisis videos? Well, it has to do with the nature and severity of the mistake: This mistake was much more straight forward then with the other two videos, so we did talk to a few astrophysicists to ask them what they thought and if we should take down the video. Their feedback was pretty clear, they thought it was still fine as the universe expansion things explained in the video are correct and they didn‚Äôt consider the local group thing as too major. This was actually a case of ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù.\n\nAlso, back when this original upload happened, Kurzgesagt was operating at pretty tight margins and just redoing a video was not easy for us. Back then the team was small and we were fighting to put new videos out. So we just swallowed the bitter pill and kept the video around.\n\nBut the video still bothered us, as far as we know this was the biggest unfixed mistake on the channel. Super frustrating, especially because the core idea of the video is so fascinating. The limit of our species. The actual limit. So yeah, we finally remade the video, sorry for taking this long, life got in the way.\n\nThe original video will stay up, you can compare the two if you want to see how far we have come in a few years in terms of production quality. All in all, we could only grow the channel and work on getting better because of direct support from you guys.

Mathematically, this equates to asking what could be legitimately, rationally added to nothing at all, without violating the principle of sufficient reason, i.e. without creating an arbitrary add on to nothing that we could never justify. If nothing is the ground state of reality then anything we add to nothing cannot violate this ground state, i.e. whatever we add must itself be some version of nothing at all, while of course not being nothing at all (because then we could never have ‚Äúsomething‚Äù). Only one thing can be added to static points without defying the principle of sufficient reason. That thing is motion. If ‚Äúnothing‚Äù = non-existence = static mathematical points, then ‚Äúsomething‚Äù = existence = moving mathematical points. Existence, in other words, is rational, mathematical motion. But why should a mathematical point move? The answer, naturally, is the principle of sufficient reason itself. If it is possible for a point to move, and there is no sufficient reason for it not to move, then it must move. The only thing that would stop a point from moving is if it violated the zero ground state of the universe. The principle of sufficient reason does not allow any particular state to be arbitrarily privileged over any other state that satisfies exactly the same conditions. Thus, there is no sufficient reason for a static universe of absolute nothingness if a dynamic universe of somethingness can just as readily satisfy exactly the same requirement for the universe never to exceed a ground state energy of precisely zero forever. There is nothing special about absolute nothingness. It is no more fundamental than any other state that necessarily obeys the compulsory ground state energy of zero of the universe. Every state that satisfies the ground state energy of the universe will and must exist since there is nothing to prevent it. Moreover it will exist necessarily and eternally. Every such state is part of the permanent fibre and fabric of existence. This is the framework of the universe, the inherent superstructure and substructure. Everything hangs on this. It fills up existence. There are no gaps at all. In Leibniz‚Äôs system, true substances were ‚Äúmetaphysical‚Äù points which, so Leibniz said, were both real and exact, while physical points were real but not exact, and mathematical points were exact but not real. In modern ontological mathematics, static mathematical points are exact but unreal, while moving mathematical points serve as the basis for both metaphysical points (concerned with minds) and physical points (concerned with matter). \n\nüìñ Mike Hockney\nOntological Mathematics - How to create the universe', ""I nearly skipped this video on my shuffled 'Watch Later' playlist because it unironically sounded like an ad."", 'My school is using this for a lesson I fricken love my school right now.', 'simplified, well explained standard model theory i ever stumbled.']"

""Uni"" meaning One, and ""Verse"" meaning Spoken Sentence.\nAnd God said, ""Let there be."" \nI\'m not religious, but as sure as a painting took a painter, a building a builder, I will not be foolish nor blind to creation and say, ""There was no Creator."" \n       I embrace evolution but more accurately to the truest form of adaptation, not one kind to another as if I evolved from a fish over millions of years, that idiotic assumption by many with no evidence. I know this because of my own research, but I understand the ""belief"" that many share thinking so because of the spoon feeding from schools and college programs.\n       Cats for example have ALWAYS been cats, you get adaptive variations such as; short, tall, fat, skinny, big, little but all of the same kind (family) they have never nor will be anything else. \n      Dogs aka Canine, same thing, whatever terms you wish to use, they have never nor will be anything else likely coming from the top of a wolf down to the unfortunate breed of poodle. All dogs.\n       Bacteria, same to adapt and change but ALWAYS remains just as the same kind, yes you guessed it, bacteria.\n\n       Do I ""believe"" in an actual Adam and Eve event, YES and here is why.\nThe strongest opposition to evolution is having to have a male and female, you have to have two to reproduce. I\'ve spent many years chasing the evolution as taught for the human evolution teachings utilizing the taught schemes of orangutang to mankind to pigs giving deformation to a human breedable concept pair, and they fail. They can and do share similar genomic (almost used the word \'design\') but lets call it information. I only came to the conclusion in short that they share a common....recipe ....maker. I don\'t know how to put it. You can call it Common Design but you don\'t have much choice. \n         I found that science teachings can be deceptive in eliminating information to skew the percentages, that bothered me as well. Our genetic similarity to the ""common ancestor"" was farther away in reality than I was taught because they eliminated what they called ""useless genetic information"" because they didn\'t understand what it went to.\n         Did Adam and Eve actually live as long as the Bible or Dead Sea scrolls record. I ""believe"" so, because you can look at the chromosomes today and see what is called, ""the life wick"" or better known as Telomeres, and it is my presumption that they actually linked together giving it an Infinity loop till ""sin"" broke that loop. Their lives were reduced to a millennial lifespan, death, sickness, disease took hold and became inherited. Then why do people only live to be about 80 years old today? Well, I have an idea as to that as well, but many that may read this won\'t grasp it but here it goes.\n       What people may refer to as, ""Noah\'s Flood"" The effect of an Ice Canopy above the Earth kind of like an egg membrane, broke and all that ice fell causing the rain/snow effects upon the earth and without that canopy life expectancy started to drop, less oxygen, thinner air pressure, it wasn\'t good. Life eventually fades to a maximum of about 120 years from a perfect health standpoint. \n       There is so much more, the true science of the river turning to blood etc. would be like a Red Tide, anyway gotta go.', 'I still dont get how anything light touches, light carries its information for us to read like color how does it even carry bring it']"

However, I can provide you with three fictional scenarios that have been depicted in various works of science fiction:\r\n\r\n1. Black Hole Cataclysm: In this scenario, a civilization or advanced entity could create a technology capable of manipulating the properties of black holes. They could initiate a chain reaction, causing a series of artificially created black holes to merge and grow exponentially. As these black holes consume matter and energy, they would eventually engulf the entire universe, leading to its destruction.\r\n\r\n2. Cosmic Collapse: The idea of cosmic collapse suggests that the universe's expansion could reverse, causing everything to contract back into a singularity. If the forces responsible for the expansion, such as dark energy, were somehow neutralized or reversed, the universe would begin collapsing in on itself. Eventually, all matter and energy would become densely packed, leading to the destruction of the universe.\r\n\r\n3. Vacuum Decay: According to some theories in physics, our universe might exist in a metastable state. In this scenario, a quantum fluctuation or high-energy event could trigger the collapse of the vacuum, resulting in the formation of a lower-energy state. This collapse would then propagate at the speed of light, creating a bubble of destruction that would expand throughout the cosmos, annihilating everything in its path.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that these scenarios are purely hypothetical and speculative, and they are not based on current scientific understanding. The actual fate of the universe is still a topic of active research and debate among scientists."", ""aight I'll follow these steps after lunch""]"

It\'s for a number of reasons but most importantly, for a greater chance at survival. \n\nNow many species are physically equipped for nature but I would argue, that intellect takes precedence over all, and despite humans not possessing the ideal anatomical structure, we are clearly at the top of the chain in terms of pure brain power.\n\nWe are told that mammals come from a common ancestor and at some point that species branches off, into the many species we have today.\n\nIn layman\'s terms, why aren\'t most species like humans? Or at the very least, why aren\'t there a significant amount of species virtually identical to us in terms of not only anatomy but intellect as well? \n\nEvery relative fish, cat, bird, insect, dog, etc., has relatively the same capacity for processing information and here we are are alone in that category, even though we\'re told we all come from the same thing.
